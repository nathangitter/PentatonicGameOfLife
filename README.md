## How it Works
The playground is a cross between a pentatonic tone matrix and Conwayâ€™s game of life. Itâ€™s an interactive music generation simulation.

Conwayâ€™s game of life is a cellular automaton that follows a few simple rules. Based on the number of cells surrounding a given cell, it comes to life, dies, or stays the same. A pentatonic tone matrix is tool to create melodies. Each row corresponds to a note on the pentatonic scale.

## Context
This playground was created for the WWDC18 scholarship program, which offers tickets to Apple's annual developer conference. Applicants submit an interactive Swift playground and written essays, which are reviewed by Apple. I was fortunate to be selected as a winner!

## Installation Instructions
1. Download/clone this repo.
2. Open the `PentatonicGameOfLife.playground` file with Xcode 9.3.
3. Follow the instructions in the playground to run.

To modify the playground, I reccomend opening the `ConwayMatrixContainerProject.xcodeproj` file. This project contains a reference to the playground, and allows auto-complete and syntax highlighting for Swift files in the playground's `Sources` folder.
